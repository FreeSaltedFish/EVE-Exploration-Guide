# 1 Reading Guide

There are many contents in this guide. Reading from the basic introduction to the "advanced" cosmic signatures will need more than 3 hours and also some ingame practices. Reading this guide repeatedly is suggested.

All contents are based on Tranquility client and English names are used for accuracy. Use Ctrl + F for searching the contents you need.

The guide contains basic and advanced parts. A new player needs only a few days and low SP for basic exploration. For the advanced parts, about one and a half months and more than 2.5m SP would be needed.

If you are a new player, please finish the Career Paths for learning the EVE gaming mechanics (referred to the other guides) before you read the following contents.
