Newbie wanna try some exploration after the official newbie tutorial but don’t know how? Veteran but already boring on ratting or camping? This guide details the exploration and provides a detailed way, which you could predominate exploration quickly.

Fly between systems, fight with the pirates of the whole universe, experience the fun of hacking, research unique exploration tips, kill the guy trying to steal your loot. This is our exploratory life. In the ingame channel “南北派专家组” we welcome everyone. Our slogan is ‘Hack the universe!’.

We are neutral and do not have any ingame organization. Our only purpose is to help new players integrate better and faster into the game.
