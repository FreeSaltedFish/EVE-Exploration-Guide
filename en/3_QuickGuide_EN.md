# 3 Quick Guide

 **Early stage**
 
1. The suggestion is to buy one-month omega cause all kinds of cloaking devices need omega. If you do not have omega, you do not have to pay but need to know how to make some safe bookmarks and escape when you have dcanned combat probes in 4AU.

2. If you didn't train any skills in the category “Scanning”, the suggestion is (buying one Large Skill Injector, only if possible) training all 7 skills in this category to III, and also another skill to III——\[Empire Faction] Frigate.

3. Buy an \[Empire Faction] Frigate (Suggestion: Heron) and fit it with [the recommended fit——Heron, Newbie exploration](Heron配置链接). Now you should have 75+ probe strength and you can begin exploring!

 **Terminal stage**
    
4. Finish training the following skills in particular order:  
The skills as which the equipment in [Steel Plates Astero](钢板小白配置链接) needs  
Cloaking IV for Covert Ops Cloaking Device II  
Astrometrics IV  
Hacking V for T2 analyzer  
Archaeology V for T2 analyzer  
(about four Large Skill Injectors in total)

5. Explore with Astero. If you still can not use Covert Ops Cloaking Device II, Astero is not suggested. You can try advanced signatures with Heron first. When you can use T2 Analyzers, the success probability in the hacking minigame would be much higher than before.

6. Train Cybernetics to V for the Implant Neural Lace 'Blackglass' Net Intrusion 920-40 and some basic skills in category “Engineering” (important). Later, finish training Astrometrics to V.

7. Now, most skills needed for exploration have been already trained. Exploring later with other ships (e.g. Covert Ops, Stratios or Tengu) could be considered. You shall plan on exploring in your own way now.
